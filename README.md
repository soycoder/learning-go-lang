|                      ☐                      | Getting started with multi-module workspaces         | Introduces the basics of creating and using multi-module workspaces in Go. Multi-module workspaces are useful for making changes across multiple modules.                        |
|                      ☐                      | Accessing a relational database                      | Introduces the basics of accessing a database using the standard library.                                                                                                        |

|                      ☐                      | Getting started with generics                        | Introduces the basics of generics in Go. With generics, you can declare and use functions or types that are written to work with any of a set of types provided by calling code. |
|                      ☐                      | Getting started with fuzzing                         | Introduces the basics of fuzzing in Go. Fuzzing can generate inputs to your tests that can catch edge cases and security issues that you may have missed.                        |
|                      ☐                      | Getting started with govulncheck                     | Introduces how to find and fix vulnerabilities with govulncheck. Govulncheck reports known vulnerabilities that affect Go code.                                                  |
